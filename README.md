# Kickstarter

Develop modern web applications with Elm and Typescript on Node with Mongo.

### Introduction

The web moves fast. It's hard to keep up. This project provides a kickstarter for
developing modern web applications. The kickstarter here will allow you to launch
into developing your application and avoid dealing with common annoyances such as
setting up your build pipeline and doing standard user authentication.

As new technology emerges that catches my attention and seems to be worth the upgrade
I may switch and update this kickstarter accordingly. Therefore, all technology
in this kickstarter is liable to be swapped.

Currently this kickstarter is composed of:
  - Mongo
  - Mongoose
  - Elm
  - Express
  - Node
  - TypeScript

So I guess that make this...MEENT Stack? (Mongo, Express, Elm, Node, Typescript)

### Local Dependencies

- MongoDB ~ 4.2x
- Node ~ 11.x
- NPM ~ 6.x
