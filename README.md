# MEEN Kickstarter

### Introduction

TODO DOC

### Local Dependencies

The project only has 3 local dependencies, `node` and `npm`, and `mongodb`.
  - node ~ V11.2.0
  - npm ~ V6.4.1
  - monodb ~ V4

You don't _need_ these versions, but it's more likely to work properly if at
least the major versions are correct.

### Project File Structure

Let's keep it simple...
  - frontend in `/frontend`
  - backend in `/backend`

As well, the [frontend README](/frontend/README.md) and the
[backend README](/backend/README.md) each have a segment on their file
structure.

### Versioning

As this is a kickstarter and not a library, it seems unclear how I would go
about using [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) (also I don't expect
anyone to ever update the kickstarter mid-project). So for now I will be simply
upgrading the version (eg. 2 to 3) when I think enough new stuff is in the
new version that it's worth upgrading (maybe I'll try and have a change-log...
we'll see...).
