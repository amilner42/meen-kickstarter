# Frontend

Copied from [this awesome kickstarter](https://github.com/simonh1000/elm-webpack-starter).

The goal is to not promote the OOP component-style development and instead focus on elm-style
data structure focussed development. I referenced the [SPA example](https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example) frequently.
